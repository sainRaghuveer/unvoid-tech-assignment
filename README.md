```
- other than that you can use your own credentials but you have to login first then you can use this app

- one route is home that will accessible for those user that are logged in only

- If you will try to log in without givin username password it will not allow you to go to home page
- In home page you have option of logout if you click on logout button you will be redirected to login page
